# House Rent Prediction with Machine Learning

House Rent Prediction
The rent of a housing property depends on a lot of factors like:

number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen
size of the property
the floor of the house
area type
area locality
City
furnishing status of the house

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

data = pd.read_csv("House_Rent_Dataset.csv")
print(data.head())

print(data.isnull().sum())

print(data.describe())

Now let’s have a look at the mean, median, highest, and lowest rent of the houses:

print(f"Mean Rent: {data.Rent.mean()}")
print(f"Median Rent: {data.Rent.median()}")
print(f"Highest Rent: {data.Rent.max()}")
print(f"Lowest Rent: {data.Rent.min()}")

Now let’s have a look at the rent of the houses in different cities according to the number of bedrooms, halls, and kitchens:

figure = px.bar(data, x=data["City"], 
                y = data["Rent"], 
                color = data["BHK"],
            title="Rent in Different Cities According to BHK")
figure.show()

Now let’s have a look at the rent of the houses in different cities according to the area type:

figure = px.bar(data, x=data["City"], 
                y = data["Rent"], 
                color = data["Area Type"],
            title="Rent in Different Cities According to Area Type")
figure.show()

Now let’s have a look at the rent of the houses in different cities according to the furnishing status of the house:

figure = px.bar(data, x=data["City"], 
                y = data["Rent"], 
                color = data["Furnishing Status"],
            title="Rent in Different Cities According to Furnishing Status")
figure.show()

Now let’s have a look at the rent of the houses in different cities according to the size of the house:

figure = px.bar(data, x=data["City"], 
                y = data["Rent"], 
                color = data["Size"],
            title="Rent in Different Cities According to Size")
figure.show()

Now let’s have a look at the number of houses available for rent in different cities according to the dataset:

cities = data["City"].value_counts()
label = cities.index
counts = cities.values
colors = ['gold','lightgreen']

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=label, values=counts, hole=0.5)])
fig.update_layout(title_text='Number of Houses Available for Rent')
fig.update_traces(hoverinfo='label+percent', textinfo='value', textfont_size=30,
                  marker=dict(colors=colors, line=dict(color='black', width=3)))
fig.show()

Now let’s have a look at the number of houses available for different types of tenants:

# Preference of Tenant
tenant = data["Tenant Preferred"].value_counts()
label = tenant.index
counts = tenant.values
colors = ['gold','lightgreen']

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=label, values=counts, hole=0.5)])
fig.update_layout(title_text='Preference of Tenant in India')
fig.update_traces(hoverinfo='label+percent', textinfo='value', textfont_size=30,
                  marker=dict(colors=colors, line=dict(color='black', width=3)))
fig.show()

House Rent Prediction Model:

Now I will convert all the categorical features into numerical features that we need to train a house rent prediction model:

data["Area Type"] = data["Area Type"].map({"Super Area": 1, 
                                           "Carpet Area": 2, 
                                           "Built Area": 3})
data["City"] = data["City"].map({"Mumbai": 4000, "Chennai": 6000, 
                                 "Bangalore": 5600, "Hyderabad": 5000, 
                                 "Delhi": 1100, "Kolkata": 7000})
data["Furnishing Status"] = data["Furnishing Status"].map({"Unfurnished": 0, 
                                                           "Semi-Furnished": 1, 
                                                           "Furnished": 2})
data["Tenant Preferred"] = data["Tenant Preferred"].map({"Bachelors/Family": 2, 
                                                         "Bachelors": 1, 
                                                         "Family": 3})
print(data.head())

Now I will split the data into training and test sets:

#splitting data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x = np.array(data[["BHK", "Size", "Area Type", "City", 
                   "Furnishing Status", "Tenant Preferred", 
                   "Bathroom"]])
y = np.array(data[["Rent"]])

xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(x, y, 
                                                test_size=0.10, 
                                                random_state=42)

Now let’s train a house rent prediction model using an LSTM neural network model:

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, 
               input_shape= (xtrain.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(25))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.summary()

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(xtrain, ytrain, batch_size=1, epochs=21)

Now here’s how to predict the rent of a housing property using the trained model:

print("Enter House Details to Predict Rent")
a = int(input("Number of BHK: "))
b = int(input("Size of the House: "))
c = int(input("Area Type (Super Area = 1, Carpet Area = 2, Built Area = 3): "))
d = int(input("Pin Code of the City: "))
e = int(input("Furnishing Status of the House (Unfurnished = 0, Semi-Furnished = 1, Furnished = 2): "))
f = int(input("Tenant Type (Bachelors = 1, Bachelors/Family = 2, Only Family = 3): "))
g = int(input("Number of bathrooms: "))
features = np.array([[a, b, c, d, e, f, g]])
print("Predicted House Price = ", model.predict(features))
